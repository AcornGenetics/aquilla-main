"""
Static structure checks for the Greengrass provisioning script
(deployment3_greengrass.sh, am#361).

Like the deployment2 tests, these read the shell script and assert its shape —
no device, no AWS. deployment3 is deployment2 with the watchtower/GHCR OTA path
swapped for Greengrass: same hardware/OS/Docker/kiosk setup, but Greengrass owns
image delivery and updates.

Run with:
